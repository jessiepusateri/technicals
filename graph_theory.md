# Graph Theory

- **bridge** - an edge of a graph whose deletion increases its number of connected components

- **connected component** - (of an undirected graph) is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected 
to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph. 

- **forest** - an undirected graph, all of whose connected components are trees; 
in other words, the graph consists of a disjoint union of trees. Equivalently, a forest is an 
undirected acyclic graph. As special cases, an empty graph, a single tree, and the discrete graph
on a set of vertices (that is, the graph with these vertices that has no edges), are examples of forests.
