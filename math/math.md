# Math

## Common Series


1/(1 - n)

```
1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... + x^n
```

(x^2 + x)/2

```
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n
```

## Combinatorics

### Permutations

#### With Repitition
n^r

where n is the number of things to choose from, and we choose r of them
(Repetition allowed, order matters)

#### Without Repitition
n!/(n − r)! 

where n is the number of things to choose from, and we choose r of them
(No repetition, order matters)

### Combinations

#### With Repitition
n!/ r!(n − r)!

#### Without Repitition
(r + n - 1)! / r! (n - 1)!
